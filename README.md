# Introduction
> This project is in early stage, many things may change often.

* **Dijkstra Algorithm Simulator** is a web application designed to visually and technically demonstrate how Dijkstra’s algorithm calculates the shortest paths in a weighted graph. This simulation provides an interactive way to understand the inner workings of one of the most fundamental algorithms used in network routing and graph theory.

##  :beginner: About
This project aims to create a simple and efficient tool to visualize how Dijkstra’s algorithm operates in real time. The web app allows users to create graphs, define edge weights, and watch as the shortest path calculations unfold dynamically. The goal is to provide an intuitive and educational experience for students, developers, and networking enthusiasts who want to grasp the algorithm’s efficiency and mechanics.

## :zap: Usage
When you open the app, you'll be able to interact with a graph interface where you can add nodes, connect them with weighted edges, and set a starting node to calculate the shortest path. The app will then animate the algorithm’s process, highlighting visited nodes and updating the shortest paths step by step.

###  :electric_plug: Installation
By clicking the link at the top of the repo, you can access the app directly in your browser.
To save the app on your device, use the install option in the browser’s menu to add it as a Progressive Web App (PWA), allowing for offline functionality and quick access.

##  :wrench: Development

### :notebook: Pre-Requisites
There are no strict requirements, but for an optimal experience:
* A *Chromium-based browser* like Google Chrome, Brave, Edge, or Opera (Safari and Firefox may not fully support all features)

## :question: FAQ
* **What is Dijkstra’s Algorithm?** <br>
  Dijkstra’s algorithm finds the shortest path between nodes in a weighted graph. It is commonly used in networking and routing to determine the most efficient routes.

* **Can I use this app offline?** <br>
  Yes, the app is designed as a PWA, allowing offline usage once it has been installed on your device.

* **Does the app support different graph sizes?** <br>
  The app supports various graph structures, but large graphs may impact performance.

* **Is my data stored anywhere?** <br>
  No, all graph data is processed locally in your browser, ensuring privacy and efficiency.
